# Survival on Society

## Why?
I worked on this project in IBM Call for Code Hackthon, which aims at reducing the impact of natural disasters through technology.
I was really excited about this hackthon because using technology to help others is just what I want!

## What?
This is an iOS Application called SOS, Survival On Society. It is a semi-centralized mutual aid contact and rescue system. The motivation is that when encountering disaster, if people around you can give you a hand, why bother waiting so long for the central authorities to help? With SOS application,

1. If you need help, post your need(lack of food & water, get hurt/trapped...).

2. If you can help others, post what you have(rescue skills such as CPR, food & water, medicine...).

3. SOS will match the helper with the victim optimally (mostly depend on distance) and they can talk via SOS.

4. If you have someone who is in great danger, you can send a distress signal for him or her.

5. SOS will also detect the frequency of needs in different region. For example, if many people in this area are hurt and no one response, then SOS will send more rescuers to there from central. That's why SOS is semi-central.

## What's good?
Giving victims chances to mutually aid largely decrease the pressure of central and also increase the efficiency of rescue and distribution of materials.
